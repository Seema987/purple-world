# Purple Delight
## Welcome to Purple Library
### This is a website for people who want to organize their photo library. 

# Website Plan

1. Install flask and create a new Flask app.
2. Create needed HTML templates. In my case following HTML templates:
        - index.html
        - edit.html
        - new.html
        - session/new.html
        - users/new.html
        - base.html
Inside each HTML add needed forms, inputs, buttons, loops and conditions. Use base.html as boilerplate. 

3. Create SQL db and tables with needed columns.

4. Use MVCR (Model View Controller Routes) format to organise codes.
