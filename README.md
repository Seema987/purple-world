## Welcome to Purple Library
### This is a website for people who want to organize their photo library. 

# Website Plan

1. Install flask and create a new Flask app.
2. Create needed HTML templates. In my case following HTML templates:
        - index.html
        - edit.html
        - new.html
        - session/new.html
        - users/new.html
        - base.html
Inside each HTML add needed forms, inputs, buttons, loops and conditions. Use base.html as boilerplate.
